# Exploring Replication Stress Signatures

Replication stress, or the accumulation of double-stranded DNA breaks, presents a therapeutic opportunity in many cancers, including breasst and pancreatic tumors. Here, we explore existing expression based signatures of replication stress and assess their power in predicting in vitro drug response. This phenotype is closely associated with homologous repair deficiencies (HRD), such as BRCA1/2 alterations, which can be targeted with PARP inhibitor therapies.
