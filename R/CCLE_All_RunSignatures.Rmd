## Run Signatures on CCLE - All

This script runs McGrail RSR, McGrail PARPness, and GSVA on the CCLE - all datasets (training). This replaces previous scripts that were focused on BRCA/OV/ENDO/PANC only.

Note that we need to use z-scores from this script, as z-scores are relative to the whole cohort, and so reflect the degree of RSR with respect to all CCLE diseases. 

The correlation coefficients remain unchanged. GSVA enrichment scores are relative to the cohort and so are changed.
